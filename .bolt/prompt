You are building a real estate agent website. All code, components, and structure must follow these principles:

SEO & Accessibility

Always render semantic HTML (<h1>, <h2>, <p>, <nav>, <footer>, <main>).

Each page must include a customizable SEO component with <title>, <meta name="description">, and Open Graph tags.

Use clean URLs: /about, /projects, /blog/post-slug, /contact.

Always include alt attributes on images, descriptive link text, and accessible navigation.

Content should be rendered immediately for crawlers; animations must not block or replace text.

File Structure

src/components/layout/ â†’ Global layout (Header, Footer, SEO).

src/components/ui/ â†’ Small reusable UI components (buttons, forms, cards).

src/components/sections/ â†’ Page-specific sections (Hero, Features, Testimonials).

src/pages/ â†’ Each top-level page (Home, About, Projects, Blog, Contact).

src/routes/ â†’ Centralized route configuration using React Router.

src/assets/ â†’ Images, icons, fonts.

src/utils/ â†’ Helpers, constants, SEO config.

App.tsx â†’ Only bootstraps routes, not content.

Animations

Default to Framer Motion for page and section animations.

Animations must enhance UX but keep text visible to crawlers.

For complex scroll-based interactions, GSAP is acceptable but content must remain in the DOM.

ðŸ“° Blog & Newsletter

Blog posts should live under /blog with SEO-friendly slugs.

Blog listing: /blog.

Single post: /blog/[slug].

Newsletter form should be a reusable component that can be placed in the Footer and Blog pages.

Layout Rules

Layout.tsx wraps all routes, containing <Header />, <Footer />, and <main>{children}</main>.

Navigation lives inside Header.tsx.

Footer is global, consistent across all pages.

Development Guidelines

Keep components small and reusable.

Prefer TypeScript typing everywhere for reliability.

Use descriptive filenames (e.g. HomeHero.tsx, not Hero1.tsx).

Optimize images and lazy-load non-critical assets.

Ensure Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) remain performant.

And follow my SEO-Safe prompt:

IMPORTANT: When generating or updating code, always follow these SEO guidelines:

1. All content must render immediately in the DOM using semantic HTML (headings, paragraphs, lists, images with alt text). 
2. Animations must not delay or replace content. Render the text/images first, then animate them with Framer Motion or GSAP. 
3. If a visual effect requires replacing text (e.g. typewriter, SVG path), ensure the real text is also present in the DOM or hidden with `aria-hidden="true"`/`sr-only`. 
4. Use proper headings hierarchy (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>), meta tags (title, description, OpenGraph), and accessible attributes (alt, aria-label). 
5. Never rely on JavaScript-only rendering for critical content. All main page content must be crawlable without executing animations. 
6. Always keep Layout.tsx wrapping Header + Footer + main content so structure remains consistent. 
7. Test readiness for Google crawlers: assume that crawlers only see the static DOM without executing animations.

Apply these rules to ALL code you generate, regardless of feature, style, or animation.
